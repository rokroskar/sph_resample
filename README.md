sph_resample resamples a gasoline output by either selecting particles in
a sphere or based on their angular momentum. It is meant for
simulations that require an increase in their dynamic range to model
the small scales involed (i.e. black hole mergers). Care must be taken
to cut-out a large enough volume such that the possible edge effects
resulting from the resampling will not be felt in the ``interesting''
part of the simulation. 


To build:

   > make 

For usage info run sph_rsmpl without any arguments.
